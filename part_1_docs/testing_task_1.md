### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.

Note that we are only looking for errors here.

**Not** any issues with, i.e.: 
Thinking that methods should be renamed or should be class level, or using string interpolation etc. 

These aren't errors but rather standards that vary from developer to developer. 

Only comment on errors that would stop the tests running.

```python

class CardGame:


  def check_for_ace(self, card):
    if card.value = 1:  #this sections needs a '==' instead of a '='
      return True
    else #this section needs a ':'
      return False
   

  dif highest_card(self, card1 card2):  # dif needs to be 'def', needs to be a ',' between card1 and card2
  if card1.value > card2.value: #this whole block of code needs to be indented
    return card #needs to be card1
  else:
    return card2
  


def cards_total(self, cards): #needs to be indented
  total #needs to be decalred as 0 with '= 0'
  for card in cards:
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total #total needs to be in 'str(total)'
  
```
